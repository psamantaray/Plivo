Suggestions:

API Name: api/v1/users
 
 1. We can send some response in the response body when token is invalid or null.
 
 API Name: api/v1/users/<phone>
 
 1. When user hit this api with a invalid phone number, response coe should be 400 or 404 instead of 200
 2. When user hit this api with a invalid phone number, we should not send a empty response body. We can send a meaningful error message.
